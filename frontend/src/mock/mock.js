Ashish's guidance has been incredible, especially for being so consistent and pushing me, even for free sometimes. This is proof that body recomp done well can make a huge difference.

The results are amazing—I've seen major improvements in strength in the gym, too. The real benefit of Ashish's coaching is the accountability; he pushes me to eat enough and provides strategic advice, like when to increase my calories, which is why I haven't hit a plateau. The guidance has definitely helped!”",
